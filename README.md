## Acappella Trainer

[View the demo here](http://kendevdesigns.com/sandbox/acappella-trainer/)

This is a lightweight web app to help train and improve your acappella singing by repeatedly lowering and then raising back the volume of a song. Test how in-tune you are with the song when the volume is lowered! Simply configure the options, and then drag and drop a .mp3 file to this page.

## Installation

```
npm install
gulp
```

## About

A weekend project that I created when I couldn't find a similar tool online. Eventually I'd want to clean up the code and add support for multiple songs / playlist.
